I'm a grad student in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the [University of Trieste](https://idp-cineca.units.it/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s2), previously graduated in math at [Politecnico of Turin](https://www.polito.it/). 
At the moment I'm working at my thesis project regarding **circuit detection** and **mechanistic interpetability** in LLM at [Area Science Park](https://www.areasciencepark.it/).

My main research interests revolve around **machine learning** and its applications, in particoular I'm deeply fascinated by the possibility of employing mathematical tools to develop a comprhensive framework to peer into LLM core mechanics and to model a [physic of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLNmgviQHPA).
